 <h2>My Design Works</h2>
 <p>
    My graphic design portfolio showcases a diverse range of work that reflects my growth, creativity, and ability to adapt to various design needs. From logo design to full branding identities, each project highlights my focus on crafting visually appealing, meaningful, and functional designs. I’ve had the opportunity to work on web design projects where I’ve honed my skills in creating user-friendly, responsive layouts that prioritize both aesthetics and usability. My print design work, including brochures, posters, and packaging, demonstrates my attention to detail and ability to create designs that translate seamlessly from screen to physical materials. I’ve also dabbled in digital design, creating social media graphics and marketing materials that capture attention and align with brand messaging. Throughout my portfolio, you’ll see a balance between artistic expression and practical problem-solving, where every design is a product of thoughtful research, collaboration, and refinement. Each piece not only represents my technical expertise but also my passion for bringing ideas to life through design, helping clients communicate their messages in a way that is both visually compelling and effective.
